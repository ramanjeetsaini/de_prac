Mysql 
    - client server architecture
    - three layers
        - Application/client layers
            - responsible for client connections, authorization, authentication, and security.

        - MySQL server layers (relational enginer)
            - responsible for parsing, analyzing, and optimizing submitted queries.
            - maintains caches and buffers
            - provides built-in recovery and backup partitioning
            - SQL interface for interacting with database
            - fed query execution plan to storage engine
        - Storage Engine layers
            - part of DBMS that write and retrieves data from physical storage

Mysql Facts
    -  /*!40100 DEFAULT CHARACTER SET latin1
        - the numeral 40100 indicated the minimum version of mysql needed to sun SHOW CREATE DATABASE 
    - CREATE DATABASE ;
        - db.opt file is created that holds database options
        - find . -name db.opt
        - use IF NOT EXISTS 
        - physical directory is created
        - case sensitive on linux and mac (Movie != movie) 
    - Collation & Character sets 
        - by default Mysql uses latin-1 -> associated collation (latin1_swedish_ci)
        - CI implies case insensitive
        - accented character stored using swedish conventions
    - inspect collation in the local machine
        - SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "c%";
    
    - ORDER by
        - column name is sort key
        - sort key is case insensitive and s=ascending by default
        - sorting depends upon character set being used and collation orderness
        - use BINARY for ASCII comparision (uppercase appear before lowercase)
    - LIMIT
        - limit <rows to display> offseet <rows to leave from top>
        - limit <offset>, <number of rows to display>
    - TRUNCATE
        - does not work with locking or transactions
        - acts as DELELTE when used with InnoDB.
    - UPDATE
        - has 2 parts (Matching, Modifications)
            - rows are determined 
            - changes are applied 
    - Cardinality is counted based on statistics stored as integers, so the value is not necessarily exact even for small tables.

    - INDEX 
        - clustered index 
            - B-tree structure (R-tree in case of spacial index)
            - physical arrangement mimics logical order 
            - way to inform DB system to cluster values physically close in index order
            - B-tree index remains in main memory
            - searching becomes easy as it guarantees fixed number of disk reads since they are balanced
            - in B+ tree the data only lives in leaf nodes
            - root and internal containes only key in which b+ tree is sorted
            - stores rows in entity called PAGE (smallest unit of data a DB can write or read from disk)
            - page containes rows and forms leaf node of b+ tree
            - pages form leaf nodes of tree
            - B+ tree
                - nodes are linked via back & next pointer
                - usefule in range queries (seek key-value and blindly follow forward pointer until the end of index)
            - DB works with pages
            - page is read into memory, all rows are loaded (16KB default size but configurable)
            - Collection of pages -> extent
            - collection of extent -> segment
            - collection of segment -> tablespace
            - system tablespace
                - collection of tables and assoc indexes
                - user tables are also included (older version)
                - separate tablespace for each user table (newer version)
            - storage of rows in page
                - pages of b-tree split and merge
                - page is full, new key is inserted and existing page splits
                - if rows are deleted, pages get merged
                - records/rows exists as singly linked list
                - new row is placed witihin the free space and linked list pointers are manipulated

            - storage on disk
                - clusteres index does not imply data rows are contiguosly stored
                - location on disk where row is written is realm of ObjectStore
                - Clus. index ensures physical and logical order appear same 

            - table Facts
                - with InnoDB in mysql, all tables are stores as clus. index with primary key as sort key
            - DB engine is Software module that DBMS uses to create, read, update, delete 
            - for mysql, InnoDB and MyISAM are famous
            - SHOW ENGINES; (Shows current DB engines)

            - Indexing rules
                - Mysql creates clus index on primary key
                - if no PK, look for UNIQUE index with columns set as NOT NULL
                - if no UNIQUE index, generates hidden index GEN_CLUST_INDEX on synthetic columns with rowID values
                - ONE clustered index per table , all other index will be secondary
        
        - Non-clustered Index 
            - leaf nodes does not hold actual data, stores pointer to that data
            - if DB engine is MyISAM, then rows are not stored in sorted order but appear as heap
            - Heap table (unordered pile of data)
            - ISAM (indexed Sequential Access Method) retrieve information from large datasets
